## User Story

AS A couple
WE WANT to see movie titles that correspond to our 'love compatibility'
SO THAT we can decide on a movie to watch together ❤️

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a love calculator button to press
WHEN we press the button
THEN a modal pops up requesting both of our first names
WHEN we submit our names
THEN we are presented with a calculating graphic for a few seconds and that couple is added to the search history 
<!-- maybe combine their two first names to make a couple name like Brangelina for Brad and Angelina? -->
WHEN the calculating graphic disappears
THEN the love calculation percentage is displayed along with movie posters representing a movie based on their love calculation
WHEN we view the percentage
<!-- will update this idea once we determine the percentage ranges. figure we could add styling to the % displayed based on our genre ranges we set  -->
THEN we are presented with a color/styling that indicates whether the compatability is high, medium or low
WHEN we view the movie titles
<!-- confirming with team -->
THEN we are presented with a fading scroll for the movie titles
WHEN we click a movie poster
THEN we are presented with the available streaming options and a new opened tab for the IMDB movie page
WHEN we click on a couple in the search history
THEN we are again presented with their list of movie titles
